## Twitter Sentimental analysis using python

Performed sentiment analysis on Twitter data to analyze public opinion trends regarding a given keyword.

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to analyze public opinion trends regarding a given keyword. It leverages Python, the Tweepy library for Twitter data extraction, and TextBlob for sentiment analysis. The project also includes data preprocessing, data visualization, and interactive user functionality.

#### Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into public sentiment regarding a specific keyword on Twitter. It accomplishes this by:

* __Extracting Tweets :__ The Python script uses the Tweepy library to extract tweets based on a user-defined keyword. To access Twitter data, it also authenticates with the Twitter API.
* __Data Preprocessing :__ Before sentiment analysis, the tweet data is cleaned and preprocessed. This includes removing URLs, special characters, and converting text to lowercase to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.
* __Sentiment Analysis :__ Sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob. Tweets are categorized into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on polarity scores.
* __Data Visualization:__ The project includes data visualization to make the analysis more accessible. It generates bar charts to display sentiment distribution and word clouds to showcase frequently occurring words related to the keyword.
* __User Interaction:__ The project offers an interactive experience for exploring sentiment-related insights. Users can input their desired keyword, and the script will fetch and analyze Twitter data accordingly.
* __Data Visualization:__ Visualizations like bar charts and word clouds are created to present the results visually.

#### Skills Utilized
- __Python:__ The project is implemented in Python, leveraging its versatility for data analysis and visualization.
* __Tweepy API:__ Tweepy is used to interact with the Twitter API, allowing the extraction of relevant tweets.
* __TextBlob:__ TextBlob is employed for sentiment analysis, simplifying the process of categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
* __Data Preprocessing:__ Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the tweet data for analysis.
* __Sentiment Analysis:__ The project showcases how to perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob's polarity scores.
* __Data Visualization:__ Visualizations like bar charts and word clouds are created to present the results visually.
